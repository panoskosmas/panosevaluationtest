# PanosEvaluationTest
This is my first time in gitHub.
This project consists of 3 main classes: 1)StatisticUtilsArray 2)StatisticUtilsArrayList and 3)AscendingMinimaAlgorithm.
For the first two , I was asked to return some statistics when getting an array of doubles or an arraylist of doubles
as an input respectively. For the 3rd one I implemented the Ascending Minima Algorithm , following the instructions in link below : http://softwarelearner.blogspot.com/2011/04/minima-in-sliding-window.html .
In addition, i tried to solve again the first problem , by using Streams to make the calculations and the second one by using "Number" Generic Type of Java as an input , in order to run for all given numeric data types.
