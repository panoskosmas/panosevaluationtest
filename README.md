# PanosEvaluationTest
<h1>This is my first time in gitHub.</h1>
<h2>This project consists of 3 main classes:</h2> <p>1)StatisticUtilsArray 2)StatisticUtilsArrayList and 3)AscendingMinimaAlgorithm.</p>
<p>For the first two , I was asked to return some statistics when getting an array of doubles or an arraylist of doubles
as an input respectively. For the 3rd one I implemented the Ascending Minima Algorithm , following the instructions in link below : http://softwarelearner.blogspot.com/2011/04/minima-in-sliding-window.html .</p>
<p>In addition, i tried to solve again the first problem , by using Streams to make the calculations and the second one by using "Number" Generic Type of Java as an input , in order to run for all given numeric data types.</p>
<p>Finally, for all the Classes above I have created Tests to see if they run properly.</p>
